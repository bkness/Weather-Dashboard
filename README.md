# Open Weather API Dashboard

## Description

This application serves as a streamlined weather forecasting tool, enabling users to retrieve current and five-day forecasts by city. Upon searching for a city, the app displays the current weather conditions alongside a five-day forecast, complete with graphical representations of anticipated weather patterns. User-entered cities are persistently stored in local storage, facilitating quick access for future reference until manually cleared. This app provides a user-friendly interface for seamless weather information retrieval and storage management.
